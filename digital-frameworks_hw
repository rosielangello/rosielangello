The member of congress I picked was former Special Agent in the FBI, Brian Fitzpatrick who was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2016 to represent he people of Pennsylvania’s Eighth Congressional District. 
This district includes Bucks County and sections of northwestern Montgomery County as well. 
His website states his top priorities in Congress are increasing economic opportunity and keeping the nation safe. 
He graduated from LaSalle University, Penn State University and the Dickinson School of Law.
Before Congress, for 14 years he served as an FBI Supervisory Special Agent fighting political corruption and supporting global counterterrorism efforts. He was embedded with U.S. Special Forces as part Operation Iraqi Freedom. He served as a Special Assistant U.S. Attorney focused on drug crimes and served as National Director for the FBI’s Campaign Finance and Election Crimes Enforcement Program. 
Fitzpatrick works on three committees; House Committee on Foreign Affairs, House Committee on Homeland Security and House Committee on Small Business. I think the one that is most interesting to me is the House Committee on Homeland Security because it deals with cybersecurity and infrastructure protection. 
He is currently seeking to ban tourist travel to North Korea. North Korea is a very dangerous place for Americans and also for the people who live there. Fitzpatrick has seen an increase in tourist travel from people of Western Countries, including the U.S. 
Fitzpatrick was named “Investigator of the Year” by the Federal Law Enforcement Foundation. I picked Fitzpatrick because not only is he from the area I grew up in but he is very well educated and has fought for our country. I like what he stands for and I think he would be a great mentor for me in regards to this class.
